# DataProject 1
A company focused on sustainable mobility with different business lines (scooters, car sharing, etc.) are planning their
arrival in Spain. When it comes to focusing different cities you would like to see which cities are accepting this type of
mobility and predict which is the best to make the landing.
Indicators such as the use of such means of transport, abandonment of the car, less use of gasoline ... are indicators that the company wants to use to make this decision.

The solution used for this problem has been: 
- Nifi for the ingestion 
- BigQuery for the storage 
- Python
