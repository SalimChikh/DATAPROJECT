In this project, two problems have been addressed:
- first Problem :
measure the effectiveness of a marketing campaign to get the client to make a fixed-term deposit in the entity, in this way we can predict whether it will be effective or not.
And this problem has been solved:

* Elaborating the random forest algorithm for the prediction of whether a client will enter a fixed term deposit after our marketing campaign or not
* Proposing solutions to make the next marketing campaign more effective.
The solution for this problem has been a mix between python and Knime 

- Second Problem : 
Feasibility for granting a personal loan, :
